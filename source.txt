write a rust program to simulate users watching video on a website, simulation would be in terms of analytics api call, for every user opening page there would be an event 'page-view' recorded with timestamp. on page load 'page-ready' would be recorded. further based on auto play or user play events would be recorded based on action. Any pause video will result in pause-video event and navigating away to other video page would record stop-video event. These events would be batched and sent as json to server using http post api. Please add option to configure number of users in parallel to simulate. it can take analytics server url for pushing the events.
